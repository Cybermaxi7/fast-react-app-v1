# Fast Pizza App

This project is based on the course "The Ultimate React Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann, available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/).

## Course Overview

In this course, I had the opportunity to build the Fast Pizza App, a web application that allows users to order pizzas. The project introduced me to a wide range of modern web development technologies and practices.

## Key Learnings

- **Redux Toolkit**: I gained proficiency in using Redux Toolkit, a powerful library for state management in React applications. This allowed for efficient handling of data and global state.

- **Thunk Middleware**: I learned how to use Thunks in Redux for asynchronous operations, such as making API requests. This was essential for interacting with the backend and fetching pizza data.

- **API Integration**: The course guided me in integrating with a RESTful API for managing pizza data and storing orders. It provided a solid foundation in working with external data sources.

- **Tailwind CSS**: The project included a crash course on Tailwind CSS, which equipped me with the skills to create attractive and responsive user interfaces quickly.

- **React Router**: I explored data loading features in React Router, leveraging modern routing practices to enhance the user experience.

This course was a valuable learning experience, offering a hands-on approach to building a real-world web application.

## Acknowledgment

I extend my gratitude to Jonas Schmedtmann for creating this instructive course and enabling me to enhance my skills in web development.
